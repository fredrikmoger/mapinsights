## Billable Hours as a GIS Consultant

A GIS consultant often works based on billable hours. This means they get paid for the time they spend working on a project. So, the clock only starts ticking the moment they begin their task.

Each project has a budget for how many hours they can work, and GIS consultants juggle various projects at once. Because of this, they need to be excellent at managing their time.

Billable hours include many tasks, from analyzing data and creating maps to meeting with clients. Even answering emails or calls about the project counts as billable time.

## The Importance of Tracking Billable Hours

Tracking billable hours is crucial in the world of GIS consulting. It shows clients the effort involved in their projects and ensures consultants are compensated for their work.

However, not every hour is billable. GIS consultants often engage in tasks like training or administrative work that don't count toward project hours. Balancing these tasks with billable work is key to a sustainable consulting career.

This system motivates GIS consultants to be productive, rewarding efficiency and expertise. The more skilled and efficient they are, the more value they bring to their projects.

## The Role of a Geospatial Consultant

GIS consultants navigate a unique field where maps and data intersect. One day, they might be designing maps for wildlife conservation; another day, they could be automating a geoprocessing workflow.

The role often combines desk work with field visits, making it a dynamic career. While much of their time is spent on computers, GIS consultants may also gather data in remote locations. This blend of technology and fieldwork allows them to explore and understand the world in meaningful ways.

> “With tools like [**Atlas.co**](https://atlas.co), GIS consultants can effectively share data with clients and collaborate with stakeholders in a streamlined way. Atlas also enables real-time contributions from multiple users—such as a recent project where over 50 people collaborated on the same map, live. This level of collaboration is transforming the industry.”

## Types of GIS Consulting Companies

GIS consultants work across a range of industries. Here’s an overview of some common types of GIS consulting companies:

### Esri Consultants

Esri, a leader in GIS technology, offers consulting services to help organizations make the most of spatial data. Esri consultants specialize in using ArcGIS products, working with sectors like government and private firms to identify and bridge technology gaps.

### Environmental Consulting Firms

Environmental GIS consultants analyze spatial data related to the environment. They might map areas impacted by pollution, prioritize cleanup efforts, or monitor wildlife habitats using GIS. Field data collection and environmental assessments are essential parts of their work.

### Transportation Consultants

In transportation, GIS consultants improve systems by analyzing traffic patterns, planning new routes, and identifying accident hotspots. By supporting smarter city planning, they help reduce congestion and enhance travel safety and efficiency.

### City Planning Consultants

City planning is a forward-thinking role within GIS consulting. Consultants design cities that balance growth with environmental sustainability, deciding where to place homes, parks, and commercial spaces. Their maps help shape the future of communities.

## Solo GIS Consultants

Being a freelance GIS consultant comes with both freedom and challenges. Freelancers choose projects and work from anywhere, but they also handle all business operations, from client acquisition to project delivery.

As a solo GIS consultant, tools like [Atlas.co](https://atlas.co) can be invaluable, enabling seamless data sharing and collaboration with clients remotely. Freelancers can also benefit from Atlas’s capability for real-time updates, allowing multiple stakeholders to view and interact with project data simultaneously.

## Is GIS Consulting Right for You?

For GIS consultants, managing billable hours can be challenging, as every hour impacts income. Delivering high-quality work within limited time frames requires efficiency.

On the positive side, every day brings new challenges. GIS consultants play a central role in decision-making across industries, turning data into actionable insights and paving the way for innovative solutions.

Working with GIS offers a rewarding career for those who enjoy data, maps, and problem-solving. It’s a field where technology meets geography, with endless possibilities for exploration and impact.
