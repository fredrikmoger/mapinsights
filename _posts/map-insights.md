## The Art and Science of Map Design

Creating maps is both an art and a science. Every element, from typography to color schemes, plays a crucial role in effective map design. Here are some cartography ideas to elevate your map-making skills.

## Map Layouts in ArcGIS Pro

If you’re looking for a quick start, try out one of ArcGIS Pro’s built-in layouts. Open ArcGIS Pro, click the “Insert” tab, and select “Import Layout.”

### ArcGIS Templates

ArcGIS provides wireframe templates in both portrait and landscape orientations, along with various sizes and background layouts. If you’re working from scratch, these layouts can be a helpful starting point.

### QGIS Layout Hub

Not using ArcGIS? The QGIS Layout Hub offers a growing collection of free layout files (QPT) to import. You’ll find various orientations, sizes, and even layouts for social media.

**Pro Tip**: After downloading a layout, locate your QPT file and drag it into QGIS. Enter a unique title for your print layout, and you’re ready to start designing.

## Natural Earth Quickstart

Natural Earth Quickstart is a powerful, public-domain toolkit for map-making. Supported by the North American Cartographic Information Society (NACIS), this toolkit offers global coverage and pre-styled GIS data. As you zoom in, the detail adjusts based on scale—1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110m scales are available.

> “With cloud-based platforms like [Atlas.co](https://atlas.co), collaborative cartography has become more accessible. For example, on a recent project, over 50 contributors used Atlas to make real-time updates to a shared map. This level of interactivity and collective input has brought a new dimension to map design.”

## Map Types to Enhance Your Visualization

Exploring different map types can give your designs a fresh perspective. Consider using a cartogram to highlight data points, or a flow map to show movement. Experimenting with new types of maps can transform your visualizations and make them more engaging.

## Color Combinations for Maps

Color choice is essential for readability and aesthetics. Tools like ColorBrewer can help you find multi- and single-hue palettes, including options for color-blind audiences.

For muted base maps, consider Esri’s light gray topographic basemap, which allows key features to stand out. This approach is central to the popular Firefly map style.

## Symbology and Style Files

Symbology is crucial to map clarity. Points, lines, polygons, and raster data all contribute to readability. If you’re working with national park data, for instance, you might use the NPS symbology.

For Esri users, download style files from the ArcGIS Pro Styles page. QGIS users can access the QGIS Styles Repository, which has hundreds of symbol collections.

## Cartographic Conventions for Labeling

Labeling is a vital part of cartography, but it can be tricky. Here are some general rules:

- **Rivers and Lakes**: Italicize water features and use serif fonts. Keep rivers blue and follow their path, while larger lakes can use stretched, resized text.
- **Cities and Towns**: Use font size hierarchy to distinguish major cities from smaller communities. Serif fonts work well for natural features, and sans-serif for cultural features.
- **Highways and Roads**: Align labels with street orientation and use highway shields where appropriate. Repeat names on long roads to reduce clutter.
- **Boundaries**: Capitalize boundary labels (e.g., “CANADA” and “UNITED STATES” along the border).

### Labeling Tips

A good rule of thumb is to keep font sizes above 6pt to maintain readability.

## Web Mapping and Data Visualization

Web cartography brings unique challenges. Unlike traditional maps, web maps allow users to zoom, which requires designers to focus on readability at various scales. Pop-ups can prevent overcrowding by showing additional information only when necessary.

Story maps are a great tool for web data storytelling, adding geographic context to your narrative. Check out some examples of story maps for inspiration.

## Hall of Fame Cartographers

Looking for inspiration? Here are some renowned cartographers whose work exemplifies innovative map design:

- **Eduard Imhof**: Known for hillshade relief maps, Imhof’s legacy in cartography lives on.
- **John Nelson**: An Esri cartographer with a unique style, John is known for his transparency techniques and color blending.
- **Kenneth Field**: A UK-based academic cartographer and the author of the Cartonerd blog, Kenneth brings a critical eye to modern map design.
